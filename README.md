Force to Horse Plus
=============

Borrows liberally from https://github.com/hank/cloud-to-butt

Chrome extension that replaces occurrences of 'force' with 'horse' and 'forcing' with 'horseing' as described in today's XKCD: http://xkcd.com/1418/

You can [install it from the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/force-to-horse-plus/mdkmacbemjohkhdlokblhipnahhoeklf) or, if you prefer, [download the CRX](https://github.com/jffry/force-to-horse/blob/master/ForceToHorse.crx?raw=true) and install it via the Extensions page in Chrome.
